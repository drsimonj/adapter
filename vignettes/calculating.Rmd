This vignette will describe how to use cleaned user log files to calculate a set of variables determined as being initially useful.

## Prerequisites

As a step in the data analysis process, calculating variables comes after the log files of user data have been read and cleaned. Although this step is directly integrated into the `read_all` function, this vignette will go into greater detail about the functions used in this stage. To learn more about the reading and cleaning steps, please read the vignettes on [cleaning](cleaning.html) and [reading](reading.html) log files.
