In collaboration with the [Defence Science and Technology Group](http://www.dst.defence.gov.au/), the [CODES Research Lab](http://sydney.edu.au/science/psychology/lab/codes/) has developed a simulation for assessing the adaptability of teams facing challenging conditions. This R package supports the management and analysis of data generated from this simulation.

This package can be installed from GitHub via the following command:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")  # To install devtools if needed
devtools::install_github("drsimonj/adapter")
```
